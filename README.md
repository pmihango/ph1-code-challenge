# Phase 1 code challenge

## Project Goals

The project is meant to test on javascript skills. 
It comprocises of three challeges namely the Students grade generator, Speed Detector and Net salary calculator
## Project details

## Challenge 1:Student Grade Generator
This progect, prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then it will output the correct grade as below:

A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.
-Open the grades.js in vs code

-Run the command 

      node grades.js

-The program runs and prompts the user to enter student score.

-Enter the student score. It should be tween 0 and 100

-The programe will return the appropriate grade for the score entered

-If you enter a figure less than 0 or greater than 100, it will prompt you to enter a score between 0 and 100



## Challenge 2: Speed Detector

-Test the program, access the speed.js file

-open the file in visual studio

-find the testing condition at the last line. 

console.log(speedDetector(70));

change the figure at the end to correspond to the driver's speed

if the speed id below 70 it will print OK

if  it is 70 it will print 0 points

if the speed entered e.g 140 produces more than 12 point, then the output will be License Suspended.
